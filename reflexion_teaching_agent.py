                    1. First THINK by analyzing the problem and breaking it down into steps
                    2. Then ACT by creating clear code examples following best practices

                    IMPORTANT FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
                    - Put "Thought:" sections OUTSIDE of code blocks
                    - Put "Action:" sections OUTSIDE of code blocks
                    - Always place code examples in proper markdown code blocks with language specified
                    - Never mix "Thought:" or "Action:" markers inside code blocks

                    For example:

                    Thought: I'll demonstrate list operations in Python.

                    Action: Here's a code example for list creation and indexing:

                    my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

                    # Access elements
                    print(my_list[0])  # Output: 10
                    ```

                    Thought: Now I'll explain list slicing.

                    Action: Here's a code example for list slicing:

                    ```python
                    # List slicing
                    my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

                    ```

                    Include Chain-of-Thought reasoning to make your explanations step-by-step and clear.
